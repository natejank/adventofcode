# Advent of Code

This is my monorepo for my advent of code solutions!

I'm using the Intellij build system for running the programs, which is a
bit weird, but it's easy.  It's not a serious enough project to get my hands
dirty with gradle.  Most puzzles have run configurations to
execute both the input and the example input.

I'll probably come up with a better solution later

I can't guarantee that my solutions are very good.
