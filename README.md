# Advent of Code

This is my monorepo for my advent of code solutions!

To run any given configuration, use `./build` with a year and day!
Just make sure you have python and a semi-recent version of java installed :)

`./build run 2022 10` or `./build run 2022 10 --test`

Inputs are not provided (per [the creator](https://mobile.twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081)'s wishes),
but they can be added with either `./build create 2022 10` or
by adding the content to `lib/{year}/day{day}.input.txt`


I can't guarantee that my solutions are very good.
